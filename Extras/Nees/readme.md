# Nees  

![](nees-img.jpg)

This script is a very loose recreation of Georg Nees early computer-generated artworks including [23-Ecke, ](https://blogs.brown.edu/hiaa-0820-s01-2017-fall/files/2017/09/Nake.pdf).  

Nees work was originally published in 1968 in [issue 19 of the magazine Rot](https://monoskop.org/File:Rot_19_Computer-Grafik_1968.pdf)

If you want to learn more about early computer art, I highly recommend this book: [Mainframe Experimentalism by Hannah Higgins & Douglas Kahn](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520268388/mainframe-experimentalism), text also available at [monoksop](https://monoskop.org/log/?p=19231)
