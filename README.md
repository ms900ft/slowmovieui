# SlowMovieUI

I built Tom Whitwell wonderful [project](https://medium.com/@tomwhitwell/how-to-build-a-very-slow-movie-player-in-2020-c5745052e4e4
) some time ago, which I really enjoyed. The only negative was that I always had to log in to my Rasberry PI to make changes and restart the Skriptand wait a wile to see the changes, so I added a web UI to the Python script.
With the UI it is possible to add new movies, delete files, change the order, brightness, contrast and position.
